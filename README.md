Tue 3 Dec

Tried to implement my first component test but I could not get Cypress to work with
Remix and React Router v7. So i made a new repo, **this** repo.

Wed 4 Dec

Worked on implementing my first component through "TDD". Managed to get my
first test green.

Thu 5 Dec

I've added styling to set the foundation for further components and functions. Also
added colorthemes based on numbers via Tailwind. These ID's will enable me to set
correct color based on received data from the backend.

Fri 6 Dec

Edited table row of color to use an enum with 5 different colors, will use these
later for customization of notes. Added post functionality to the api and started
to implement the modal / form where notes will be added.
